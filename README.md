## Introduction
This project refer to [Extensive Facial Landmark Localization with Coarse-to-fine Convolutional Network Cascade](http://www.faceplusplus.com/wp-content/uploads/FacialLandmarkpaper.pdf). In this project, we present a new approach to localize extensive facial landmarks with a coarse-to-fine convolutional network cascade. This paper design a four-level convolutional network cascade, which tackles the problem in a coarse-to-fine manner. In this system, each network level is trained to locally refine a subset of facial landmarks generated by previous network levels. In addition, each level predicts explicit geometric constraints (the position and rotation angles of a specific facial component) to rectify the inputs of the current network level. The combination of coarse-to-fine cascade and geometric refinement enables our system to locate extensive facial landmarks (194 points) accurately in the [300-W facial landmark localization challenge](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/300-W/).
